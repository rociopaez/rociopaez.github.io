Today I learned to distinguish objects and classes:

I'm pretty happy because I have learned about the different kinds of objects:

**Array**  
set of objects, but it is also an instance of the Array class.  
An array of days of the week:  
`array = ['monday', 'Tuesday', 'wendsday', 'thursday', 'friday']`

**Fixnum**  
It is an integer, no decimal places.  
37

**Float**  
They are numbers with decimals.  
4.3

When Ruby programs the classes always start with upper case:

For example: Array, Float, Tree

When you want to create a new object in a class use: `new` and it will call the `initialize` method.
