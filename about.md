My name is Rocio Paez, I'm 32 and I've been working on technology related logistics for my entire professional life.

I always loved working with computers. Last November I took a 3-month course on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I loved it. I discovered how a website is built, and the proper way to give styles to a page.

This year I decided I wanted to learn to program with Ruby, I did a basic course and I loved it too.
So I applied to the Summer of Code project with a project about Migraine (I will tell you more about it later).

I will be working on this project as a volunteer for 3 months, from July 1 until the end of September.
I will record my daily progress on my blog.
