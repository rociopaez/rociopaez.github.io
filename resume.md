One of my hobbies is dancing flamenco, I've danced every night (Mon-Sat) since 2007, itâ€™s my passion.  
At 32 years old I discovered that I have a second passion, and it is programming. It came at a time in my life I felt discouraged because I did not love my job, and I did not know what was what I really wanted to do for the life, I am now happy to start working as a programmer.
